Description: This package includes a trichotomous classification algorithm 
  to classify a training dataset into two groups. The algorithm produces a 
  tree of which each knot has three splits; a "positive" split, a "negative" 
  split, and a "middle" split. The middle split will be further subdivided 
  into three splits until a stopping criterion is met. The package generates 
  an object of class "trictree" which can be used to generate summary results 
  using generic functions. The package also includes a prediction function 
  which can be used to apply the estimated trichotomous classification tree 
  to a new testing dataset.
